# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  Augmenting the previous analysis of averaging the ride fares and looking at them by city type, this analysis takes a deeper look at the total fares over time by the city types every week from 01/01/2019 to 04/29/2019.

From the results, we can deduct that Urban cities by far completed the most rides at 1,625 rides. Additionally, urban regions had the lowest average fare per ride and driver, respectively at $24.53 and $.67 cents. Rural riders paid a little over $10 more than urban riders, with an average fare per ride of $34.62. Urban drivers completed 13x more trips than rural riders; And, 1,000 more trips than suburban drivers. Drivers in urban areas areas also experience a significant payout disparity against rurual drivers as their rides are more than -1,200% less than rural drivers at $.67 cents versus $8.05 for rural drivers.

When the data is confined down to just the timespan between Jan - April, all three city types experience their peak total fare around late February to early March. With rural riders having the lowest fair ~$450 USD, suburban riders having their max fares around ~$1450 USD, and urban riders paying a total of ~$2500 USD.

## Summary

* Because there's an over 1200% payout for rural drivers over urban drivers, urban drivers could be incentivized to do more rides in rural areas, as this could help bring them more money and increase their $.67 average fare per driver, and also get more drivers out in the rural areas where there's over 1,500 more drivers in urban areas than rural areas.
* It would also be wise to see what's occuring en suburban areas near the end of April to see why suburban riders experience a much higher demand for rides around that time.
* While rural riders seem to be relatively stable in their amounts of rides throughout the year, the total fares throughout the year for suburban and urban city types seem to have much larger differences in amounts. These amounts could become more stable if Pyber was to get more drivers in areas that need drivers the most so that riders could get more stable fare amounts each time they ask for a ride.
